Description: Implements efficient Gibbs sampling procedures for multivariate grouped 
    random effect probit model estimation. The package provides methods for analyzing
    longitudinal data with time-varying household membership, allowing for correlated
    random effects within 'superhousehold' clusters. Includes novel MCMC estimation
    procedures that ensure positive definiteness of correlation matrices while modeling
    covariate-dependent correlations between household effects.
